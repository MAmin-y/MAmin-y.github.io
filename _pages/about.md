Hi! I am Mohammad Amin Yousefi, a senior bachelor student in Computer Engineering at the University of Tehran. Through my coursework, research experiences, and personal projects, I have developed a strong interest in the fields of Deep Learning and Computer Vision.[GitHub page](https://mamin-y.github.io/)

Recently, my curiosity has deepened in the area of Computer vision, particularly in topics such as video processing and medical image processing. In addition, I have a keen interest in Deep Generative Models' robustness, interpretability, and fairness of deep learning models. My goal is to expand my knowledge in these areas and contribute to advancing the field, working under the guidance of leading experts in the community.
